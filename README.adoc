= yamlsort

https://jbang.dev/[JBang] utility to sort a multi-document https://yaml.org/[YAML] file by using https://github.com/yaml-path/YamlPath[YamlPath].

== Usage

If you have `jbang` available in your system, just run:

`jbang yamlsort@someth2say`

We recommend "installing" the `yamlsort` command as a JBang application:

`jbang app install yamlsort@someth2say`

After running this command, open a new terminal session to start using `yamlsort`:

`yamlsort --help`

== Use cases

YamlSort is built to sort https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#91-documents[multi-document yaml files].
It sorts the documents in several dimensions:

. Reorder documents given in a *given order*.
. Reorder document keys in natural order.
. Reorder collections of scalar values in natural order.
. Reorder collections of maps in a *given order*.

"*Given order*" means that elements are sorted in the natural order of a value extracted from each element by applying an YamlPath expression.
The https://github.com/wwkimball/yamlpath/wiki/Segments-of-a-YAML-Path[YamlPath] expression must return a scalar value.

LetÂ´s see some examples:


=== Ordering keys

Given the following multi-document file:

.simple.yml
----
---
order: 2
zz: value
---
zz: text
order: 1
----

Keys in both documents have different order.
The default behaviour of YamlSort is sorting the keys of all the documents provided.
Simply provide the documents to YamlSort to sort the keys: `yamlsort -i simple.yml`.

.yamlsort -i simple.yml -y order
----
---
order: 2
zz: value
---
order: 1
zz: text
----

Keys are now sorted in alphabetical (natual) order.

If you want to retain the order of the keys in each document, disable key ordering with the `--no-sortKeys` option:

=== Ordering documents

Given the following multi-document file:

.simple.yml
----
---
order: 2
zz: value
---
order: 1
zz: text
----

You can sort documents given the value of the `order` field with `yamlsort -i simple.yml -y order`.

The resulting document will be printed to the standard output:

.yamlsort -i simple.yml -y order
----
---
order: 1
zz: text
---
order: 2
zz: value
----

As you can see, the documents are now sorted by the value of the field `order`.

=== Complex ordering

In some cases, ordering based on a single value is not enough.

The following example presents a more complex situation:

.complex.yml
----
---
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: alpha
---
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: beta
---
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: beta
---
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: alpha
----

We want to sort the documents by *both* the `kind`  and the `metadata.name` field.
Even If we sort by the value of each of those fields, the order of the documents would still be incorrect.

The solution is ordering using both fields in a single pass.
To do so, you can two options:

* Provide multiple `-y` options with a single YamlPath query each: `yamlsort -i complex.yml -y "kind" -y "metadata.name"`
* Provide a single `-y` option with multiple YamlPath queries, comma separated:  `yamlsort -i complex.yml -y "kind,metadata.name"`

In both cases, the result is the same.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
a|
.yamlsort -i complex.yml -y "kind,metadata.name"
----
---
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: alpha
---
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: beta
---
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: beta
---
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: alpha
----
a|
.yamlsort -i complex.yml -y "metadata.name,kind"
----
---
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: alpha
---
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: alpha
---
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: beta
---
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: beta
----
|===

Note that the order of the YamlPath queries is important.

=== Ordering lists of scalar values

We learnt how to sort documents and keys.
But YAML includes another construct that might require ordering: Lists

.list_of_scalars.yml
----
---
names:
- Jordi
- Cristina
numbers:
- 1
- 3
- 2
----

The option `-l` of YamlSort to sort lists of scalar values.
This option accepts a YamlPath query to select the list to sort.
In this example, if we want to sort the list of names: `yamlsort -i list_of_scalars.yml -l "names"`

.yamlsort -i list_of_scalars.yml -l "names"
----
---
names:
  - Cristina
  - Jordi
numbers:
  - 1
  - 3
  - 2
----

The list `names` is now sorted in alphabetical order, while the list `numbers` was left intact.

You can order multiple lists in the same command by providing multiple YamlPath queries, either separated by comma, or by providing the `-l` option multiple times.

.yamlsort -i list_of_scalars.yml -l "names,numbers"
----
---
names:
  - Cristina
  - Jordi
numbers:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
----

Ordering lists applies to *all* documents provided.

[IMPORTANT]
If one of the YamlPath does not resolve to any value, then it is ignored for the document. +
If the YamlPath resolves to an element that is not a list containing *only* scalar values, then an error message is shown (via the StdErr channel), and the YamlPath is ignored for the document.

=== Ordering lists of maps

Even ordering list of scalars is sometimes not enough.
Observe the following example:

.list_of_maps.yml
----
---
people:
  - gender: male
    name: Jordi
  - gender: female
    name: Cristina
pets:
  - name: Sharona
  - name: Azabache
----

In this example each element of the lists is a map, not a scalar.

To sort a list, we need to provide with two pieces of information:

. The list to sort.
. The value (scalar) in each map to define the order.

In YamlSort you can set the order of this list by providing the `-m` option.
This option requires two YamlPath queries, one to select the list to sort, and another to select the value that defines the order.
Provide both values in the same string, separated by `@@`. For clarity, you can also add spaces around the separator: `` @@ ``.

As an example, to sort in  the `people` list by the value of the `name` field, use the following command: `yamlsort -i list_of_maps.yml -m "people @@ name"`

.yamlsort -i list_of_maps.yml -m "people @@ name"
----
---
people:
  - gender: female
    name: Cristina
  - gender: male
    name: Jordi
pets:
  - name: Sharona
  - name: Azabache
----

[IMPORTANT]
If one of the YamlPath does not resolve to any value, then it is ignored for the document. +
If the YamlPath resolves to an element that is not a list containing *only* maps, then an error message is shown (via the StdErr channel), and the YamlPath is ignored for the document.

=== Stable sort

All sort operations performed by YamlSort are _stable_

This means that, if two elements A and B have the same ordering value, and A is placed before B before sorting,
then the element A will be placed before B after sorting.

For example, given the following documents:

.stable.yml
----
---
name: Cristina
orientation: North
---
name: Jordi
orientation: North
---
name: Cristina
orientation: South
---
name: Jordi
orientation: South
----

When sorting the documents by the `name` field, stable sort ensures that the `orientation` field retains the original order.

.yamlsort -i stable.yml -d name
----
---
name: Cristina
orientation: North
---
name: Cristina
orientation: South
---
name: Jordi
orientation: North
---
name: Jordi
orientation: South
----

=== Input

To facilitate usage within Linux systems, if no `-i` option file is provided, then the standard input is used to read the YAML documents.
This feature provide interesting use cases with other tools that generate or consume YAML files.

.Piping from a previous command
----
cat myfile.yml | yamlsort -y kind
----

YamlSort does not write the output results into any file, but into the StdOut channel.
This enables chaining the output to other tools (or even the same YamlSort).

.Chaining results to the next command
----
yamlsort -i myfile.yml -y kind,metadata.name | yq '({"kind": .kind})'
----
